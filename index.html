                <p>
                    This project was part of my 4th semester at Aarhus University, with sustainable energy futures as the overarching theme. Several companies presented cases, and my group chose to focus on transport—specifically e-bikes. Aarhus is a very bike-friendly student city with many hills, making e-bikes an ideal option for many citizens. However, many still rely on cars, often for valid reasons, which contributes to heavy traffic in certain areas. At the same time, designing a solution that simply convinces car owners to buy new e-bikes is not the most sustainable approach. Since e-bikes are already quite common in Aarhus, we instead focused on creating a design that could extend the lifespan of existing e-bikes and make them more sustainable.   </p>         </div>

                <h4>Batteritta</h4>
                <p>
                    Batteritta is an e-bike battery avatar—an anthropomorphized companion that communicates the battery’s needs and status. Inspired by the 90s toy pet Tamagotchi, it is designed to foster an intuitive relationship with your battery, encouraging better care and extending its lifespan. Since the battery is the most costly and wasteful component of an e-bike, there are strong economic, functional, and environmental reasons to maintain it properly. By introducing anthropomorphization, we add a fourth dimension: an emotional incentive. The pet-like avatar motivates users to care for their battery in ways that align with the optimal conditions for preserving large lithium batteries.                               </p>

                <p>
                    In this design project, I collaborated with two fellow Digital Design students, taking on the roles of project lead, UX designer, and UI designer. In the early research phase, I proposed methods, facilitated processes, and took initiative in reframing the problem. I conducted interviews, led internal ideation sessions, guided evaluations, and developed personas that informed the rest of the project. My contributions included creating lo-fi prototypes on paper and in digital tools, and ultimately designing and programming the interface for an interactive prototype on a Raspberry Pi in Python, displayed on a 32x32 LED screen.                                </p>

                <h4>The process</h4>
                <p>
                    The project started from a broad challenge and a set of initial problem statements that felt uncreative and lacked impact—such as persuading car users to switch to bikes or making e-bikes more fun and convenient. Through in-depth UX research, we discovered that car owners rely on cars for advantages that e-bikes simply cannot provide. This led us to reframe the problem toward improving the sustainability of e-bikes already in use. Such an approach also responds to the pressing need to counteract consumerist tendencies in Western society. The prototype and project was later showcased at the annual Aarhus University Design Expo, where it was awarded “Most Innovative Idea” by popular vote.    </p>            </div>

                    Different health workers from Region Midtjylland presented a design case consisting of the issues of inclusion in the health sector. One of these issues lies in the handling of homeless people by hospitals especially, where their systems are not built to handle patients with no address. Thus, homeless patients are not able to be treated with proper dignity and professionalism, and are not able to be monitored or contacted after being discharged.                </p>

                <p>
                    My team's solution to the problem, was to focus on the issues experienced by nurses in the current discharge system, and design an alternative. As the problem was complex and sensitive, a larger coordinated solution would be required, where institutions could cooperate with groups like the existing "street team", to monitor people where they are. to design an intuitive and user friendly interface, that could be integrated, we decided to begin a complete re-design of the current discharge report, MedCom. Our design offered fewer interactions, much clearer visual hierarchy and communication, and widgets to make interaction easier, compared to the old system.                </p>

                    During the project, I was in had the responsibility for managing the project, planning our work, and keeping focus on the task, while also doing UX studies and interface design. I participated in an important ethnographic field study, where a previously homeless person offered a guided tour of the streets of Aarhus, while telling us about life as a homeless person in the city. I further facilitated an divergent ideation workshop, worked on our interactive prototype and facilitated an interview with the head nurse of Randers Hospital.                </p>

                <p>
                    In the early stages of our process, we were unsure of how a digital solution would be able to make a difference. In many areas, the issue we were dealing with, would be better solved with improvements to social or political areas. After much research, we decided our expertise was best suited to improve the current out-dated discharge system used by nurses. The entire medical communications system was complex and sub-optimal according to nurses and our own observations. We therefore began a complete re-design of patient discharge, that assumed cooporation possibilities with existing medical organisations that specialize in dealing with homeless people. Though implementation would require a re-design of MedCom entirely and structural expansions of the communication network, it would provide improved UX for nurses and possibilities for better monitoring and more dignified treatment of homeless people.                </p>

We chose to focus on the sensitive issue of homeless people, particularly when discharging them, as current systems are not built to handle this. Our solution was a rework of the current discharge report interface, with an alternative path for patients with no address. I was highly involved with qualitative etnographic studies, and managing the agile project phases and team efforts. Large areas of the issue were, however, discovered to not be requiring non-technological solutions.

                    Dokk1 is a cultural institution in Aarhus that serves as a library, citizen service, and community hub. While the building offers many innovative spaces, the main staircase stood out as underutilized and uninspiring compared to the rest of Dokk1’s design. As digital design students, we were challenged to reimagine the staircase as an engaging element that could attract more people and contribute to the overall visitor experience.                </p>

                    Our final concept was a large-scale interactive installation on the staircase, designed as a painted map of Aarhus with integrated LED lights. The LEDs respond to live data from smartphones, visualizing where people gather across the city. Popular spots such as ARoS or Bruuns Galleri would light up in red when crowded, while smaller cultural venues could glow green to draw attention to lesser-known local activities. In this way, the staircase not only became visually attractive but also a real-time cultural guide, inspiring curiosity about both well-known and hidden parts of Aarhus.                </p>

I helped plan and run an ideation workshop, including warm-up activities, brainstorming, and evaluation. I also participated in field research using “fly on the wall” observations, and helped synthesize our insights into focus points. Later, I worked on refining our design concepts, sketching the interactive map idea, and creating the mock-up of the staircase with LEDs.                </p>

                    The process began with ethnographic observations around Dokk1, where we noted how families, students, and commuters used the building and its surroundings. Our insights revealed that the staircase was primarily used for passing through, rather than as a space for staying. Through collaborative workshops, we generated multiple design ideas—from playful concepts such as a giant Snake game to more critical ones, like a fading LED tree visualizing Amazon deforestation. After evaluation, we refined our concept into the interactive city map. The result was a design that combined playfulness, cultural awareness, and urban connectivity, while making the staircase more inviting for all visitors.                </p>

                    We reimagined Dokk1’s main staircase by designing an interactive city map with LEDs that visualize where people gather in Aarhus. I facilitated parts of the process, contributed to research, ideation, and prototyping, and helped develop the final mock-up. The project demonstrated how even transitional spaces like staircases can be transformed into engaging cultural touchpoints.                </b>

                <p>
                    Employees from Region Midtjylland presented a wide array of issues concerning inclusivity in the health sector. We chose to focus on the sensitive issue of homeless people, particularly when discharging them, as current systems are not built to handle this. Our solution was a rework of the current discharge report interface, with an alternative path for patients with no address. I was highly involved with qualitative etnographic studies, and managing the agile project phases and team efforts. Large areas of the issue were, however, discovered to not be requiring non-technological solutions.
